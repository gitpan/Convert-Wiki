TODO List for Convert::Wiki:

* better txt input filtering (definition lists, tables etc)
* add table support (for tab-delimited txt tables)
* add a improved testsuite with various examples
* implement Node::prev() and Node::next() to get newlines under
  control (add a newline before headline if prev node is not a
  headline)
* implement interlinking (once per "area after headline", "once per
  paragraph" and always)
