TODO List for Convert::Wiki:

* better txt input filtering (definition lists, tables etc)
* add table support (for tab-delimited txt tables)
* improve testsuite with even more examples
* interlinking will turn the same phrase in subsequent paragraphs
  into links. This could be toned down, either by distances (at least
  1000 bytes beteen links?) or not before next headline.
  Likewise, a phrase shouldn't be linked in two consequtive list items.
* interlinking phrases that match other subphrases has problems like:
 
     Foo|foobar
     bar
 
  will turn "foobar" into "[[Foo|foobar]]" and then this into
  "[[Foo|foo[[bar]]]]" - ugh.
